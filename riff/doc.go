/*

Package riff is package implementing a simple Resource Interchange File Format
(RIFF) parser with basic support for sub formats such as WAV.

The goal of this package is to give all the tools needed for a developer
to implement parse any kind of file formats using the RIFF container format.

Basic support for wav format was added so the headers are parsed and the duration of
a wav file can be easily accessed (See the examples below).
